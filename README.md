# IotInsight
IoT forensic tool development project

### How to install

* Download & install python 3.x from official website

  [Download Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.4/python-3.6.4.exe)

  **You should enable the windows PATH (system environment) option while installing python.**

* Run install-dependency.bat or
  * Download & Install winpcap
  Because of packet dump file level analysis, you have to install winpcap if your computer doesn't installed winpcap or wireshark.

  [Download latest winpcap](https://www.winpcap.org/install/)

  * Download & Install node.js
  Because the tool is running, you have to install nodejs if your computer doesn't installed nodejs.

  [Download latest nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

* Run install-library.bat or
  ```
  pip install -r "api\requirements.txt"
  npm install
  npm run rebuild
  ```
  **Note: The sqlite3 module of nodejs will rebuild the module due to a conflict with electron. If you encounter errors during the process, run Powershell as an administrator and write the following command `npm install -global -production windows-build-tools`**


### How to run IoTInsight

* Run run.bat or
  ```
  npm run electron
